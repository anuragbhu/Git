Git is a version control system.
Git helps you keep track of code changes and who made it.
Git is used to collaborate on code.

A README.md file that describes the repository

What does Git do?
  Manage projects with Repositories
  Clone a project to work on a local copy
  Control and track changes with Staging and Committing
  Branch and Merge to allow for work on different parts and versions of a project
  Pull the latest version of the project to a local copy
  Push local updates to the main project

Working with Git
  Initialize Git on a folder, making it a Repository
  Git now creates a hidden folder to keep track of changes in that folder
  When a file is changed, added or deleted, it is considered modified
  You select the modified files you want to Stage
  The Staged files are Committed, which prompts Git to store a permanent snapshot of the files
  Git allows you to see the full history of every commit.
  You can revert back to any previous commit.
  Git does not store a separate copy of every file in every commit, but keeps track of changes made in each commit!
  
 What is GitHub?
  GitHub is the largest host of source code in the world, and has been owned by Microsoft since 2018.

Check which version of Git:
$ git --version

Configure Git:
  If you want to set the username/e-mail for just the current repo, you can remove global
  Now let Git know who you are. This is important for version control systems, as each Git commit uses this information:
$ git config --global user.name "anuragbhu"
$ git config --global user.email "test@anurag.com"

$ mkdir myproject
$ cd myproject

Initialize Git:
  Git creates a hidden folder to keep track of changes.
  Once you have navigated to the correct folder, you can initialize Git (Initialized empty Git repository) on that folder:
$ git init

ls will list the files in the directory:
$ ls

Check the Git status and see if it is a part of our repo:
$ git status

Git Staging Environment:
  Staged files are files that are ready to be committed to the repository you are working on.
$ git add test.html
$ git add --all

Git Commit:
  Git considers each commit change point or "save point". It is a point in the project you can go back to if you find a bug, or want to make a change.
  When we commit, we should always include a message.
$ git commit -m "First release of Hello World!"

Git Commit Log:
  To view the history of commits for a repository, you can use the log command:
$ git log

Git Help:
  See all the available options for the specific command:
$ git command -help
$ git commit -help
  See all possible commands:
$ git help --all

New Git Branch:
$ git branch hello-world-images

The * beside branch name specifies that we are currently on that branch:
$ git branch

Checkout is the command used to check out a branch. Moving us from the current branch, to the one specified at the end of the command:
$ git checkout hello-world-images

Emergency Branch (hypothetical):
  Now imagine that we are not yet done with hello-world-images, but we need to fix an error on master.
  I don't want to mess with master directly, and I do not want to mess with hello-world-images, since it is not done yet.
  Using the -b option on checkout will create a new branch, and move to it, if it does not exist
  So we create a new branch to deal with the emergency:
$ git checkout -b emergency-fix

Git Branch Merge:
  We have the emergency fix ready, and so let's merge the master and emergency-fix branches.
  First, we need to change to the master branch:
$ git checkout master
$ git merge emergency-fix

As master and emergency-fix are essentially the same now, we can delete emergency-fix, as it is no longer needed:
$ git branch -d emergency-fix

Merge Conflict:
  The merge failed, as there is conflict between the versions for test.html.
  This confirms there is a conflict in test.html, but the other files are ready and staged to be committed. So we need to fix that conflict.
   Open the file in the editor and see the differences between the versions and edit it like you want.
   Now merge and delete the branch.
